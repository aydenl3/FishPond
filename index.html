    <p class="description">
      Fish Pond is an interactive environment that attempts to demonstrate behavioral evolution. <br>
      Fish are controlled by a string of letters that prioritize different behaviors.<br>
      Add a word with "M" "W" "F" or "H" below to begin.

    <p class="description">
      Fish Pond was a genuine effort to create behavioral evolution. <br>
      The idea that creatures could evolve their behavior over time excited me,<br>
      and I thought that trying to model this kind of interaction would be <br>
      engaging and difficult. After having learned about both procedural generation<br>
      and autonomous agents, I felt this kind of project could really be fun to play<br>
      with, and see what happens.
