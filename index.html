    <p class="description">
      Fish Pond is an interactive environment that attempts to demonstrate behavioral evolution. <br>
      Fish are controlled by a string of letters that prioritize different behaviors.<br>
      Add a word with "M" "W" "F" or "H" below to begin.

    <h2 class="subheader">Artist Statement</h2>

    <p class="description">
      Fish Pond was a genuine effort to create behavioral evolution. <br>
      The idea that creatures could evolve their behavior over time excited me,<br>
      and I thought that trying to model this kind of interaction would be <br>
      engaging and difficult. After having learned about both procedural generation<br>
      and autonomous agents, I felt this kind of project could really be fun to play<br>
      with, and see what happens.

    <h2 class="subheader">Postmortem</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Fish Pond turned out a little simpler than I would have liked. <br>
      In the future, I think I would commit to trying to accomplish this<br>
      in a game engine for better visual options. All that being said,<br>
      It was incredibly fun and refreshing to remake game mechanics "by hand"<br>
      instead of just clicking boxes for collision and classes.<br>
      Creating objects and classes and managing the way in which memory is stored <br>
      was alot of fun for this project!!

      Everything was my design and creation. I used P5 JS as a tool for this project before moving it to the web.
